This is a collection of code examples using the D3.js library. 
D3 (Data-Driven Documentation) is a javascript library created in 2011 focused on producing visual representation of data in dynamic and interactive ways. 
If other pieces of code are used it is specified in the examples individual READMEs. 

To run the code in this project no installation is required since it uses CDN to access the D3 library. 

In this project the theme of time and space is explored and looked at in different visual representations.
